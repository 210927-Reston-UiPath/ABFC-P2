 - Special editions?
 - Exclusive games?
 - GAME PASS? 
ABFC Price Checker Automation will let a user input a game name or a wishlist of games to recieve a report about their potential purchases. The Robot will check a database to see if the game is already stored, if not it will go to the listed sites and pull the prices. The Robot will then compare the prices and produce a PDF output that will let the user know the price at the best value and if that price is worth paying compared to historical sale data.
